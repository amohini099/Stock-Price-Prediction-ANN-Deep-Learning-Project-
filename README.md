# Stock-Price-Prediction-ANN-Deep-Learning-Project-
tensorflow keras, NLP
1. This model is based on time series forcasting .The goal of this project was to build a neural network model to predict stock prices using the TensorFlow library.
2.In this project we Created a neural network model with three dense layers and compiled it using the 'adam' optimizer and the 'mean_squared_error' loss function.
3.  this projects needs to predict stock prices, which is a continuous variable. Therefore, this is a regression problem. Calculated training and testing Mean squre errors ploted this through graph.
